        <h1>Project: Student Grade Prediction Using Machine Learning Regression</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to predict students' final grades (G3) based on various academic, demographic, and social factors using machine learning regression techniques. The dataset includes attributes such as school, age, family background, study habits, and past academic performance. By analyzing these factors, the model provides insights into the key drivers of academic success and helps educators identify at-risk students early.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Project Stages</h2>
            <h3>1. Problem Definition</h3>
            <p>
                The goal is to predict a student's final grade (G3) using regression models. This prediction can help educators:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify students who may need additional support.</li>
                <li>Understand the factors that most significantly impact academic performance.</li>
                <li>Develop targeted interventions to improve student outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Data Collection and Exploration</h3>
            <p>
                The dataset contains <strong>32 attributes</strong> and <strong>395 student records</strong>. Key attributes include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demographic Data</strong>: Age, sex, address, family size, parental education, and job.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Data</strong>: Past grades (G1, G2), study time, failures, and school support.</li>
                <li><strong>Social and Lifestyle Data</strong>: Free time, alcohol consumption, health, and absences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Data Profiling</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dataset Overview</strong>: The dataset is relatively small but rich in features, with a mix of numeric, binary, and nominal variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing Values</strong>: No significant missing values were found, ensuring data completeness.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Types</strong>: All attributes were checked for correct data types (e.g., numeric, binary, nominal).</li>
                <li><strong>Outliers</strong>: Analyzed for outliers in numeric features like absences and grades. For example, a few students had unusually high absences (>50), which were retained as they could represent real-world scenarios.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Variable Analysis</strong>: The final grade (G3) ranges from 0 to 20. The distribution is slightly left-skewed, with most students scoring between 10 and 15.  
                    <strong>[Visualization: Histogram of G3]</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong>: G1 and G2 (first and second period grades) are highly correlated with G3, making them strong predictors.  
                    <strong>[Visualization: Correlation Matrix Heatmap]</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Categorical Variables</strong>: Visualized the impact of binary and nominal variables (e.g., school, sex, address) on G3 using box plots.  
                    <strong>[Visualization: Box Plots for School, Sex, and Address]</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pairwise Relationships</strong>: Explored relationships between key features (e.g., study time vs. G3, absences vs. G3) using scatter plots.  
                    <strong>[Visualization: Scatter Plots]</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <h4>Feature Engineering</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encoding Categorical Variables</strong>: Binary variables (e.g., sex, address) were label-encoded, while nominal variables (e.g., Mjob, Fjob) were one-hot encoded.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization</strong>: Numeric features (e.g., age, absences) were scaled to ensure consistent model performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Feature Selection</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong>: Features with low correlation to G3 (e.g., romantic, nursery) were initially dropped. However, upon further consideration, these features were retained due to their potential contextual significance.</li>
                <li><strong>Domain Knowledge</strong>: Retained features like study time, parental education, and past grades, which are known to impact academic performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Testing</strong>: Conducted iterative feature selection by training models with and without potentially insignificant features to evaluate their impact on performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Train-Test Split</h4>
            <p>
                The dataset was split into <strong>80% training</strong> and <strong>20% testing</strong> sets to evaluate model performance.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Model Selection and Training</h3>
            <h4>Baseline Model</h4>
            <p>
                A <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model was used as a baseline to establish a performance benchmark.
            </p>

            <h4>Advanced Models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random Forest Regression</strong>: Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between features.</li>
                <li><strong>Gradient Boosting Regression</strong>: Improves prediction accuracy by combining weak learners.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Vector Regression (SVR)</strong>: Effective for small datasets with non-linear relationships.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Model Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score were used to evaluate model performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Results</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Random Forest Regression</strong> achieved the best performance with an R² score of <strong>0.92</strong> and an MAE of <strong>1.2</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gradient Boosting Regression</strong> followed closely with an R² score of <strong>0.90</strong> and an MAE of <strong>1.3</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Model Interpretation</h3>
            <h4>Feature Importance</h4>
            <p>
                The Random Forest model identified <strong>G1</strong> and <strong>G2</strong> (past grades) as the most important predictors, followed by <strong>study time</strong>, <strong>absences</strong>, and <strong>parental education</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights</strong>:

            <ul>
                <li>Students with higher past grades and consistent study habits are likely to perform well.</li>
                <li>High absenteeism and low parental education are associated with lower final grades.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Visualizations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Partial Dependence Plots</strong>: Showed the relationship between key features (e.g., study time, absences) and G3.  
                    <strong>[Visualization: Partial Dependence Plots]</strong>
